        <h2>Why it is important to foster</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>It reduces euthanasia.</li>
            <li>It helps make space for more animals in shelters.</li>
            <li>Fostering helps animals learn how to socialize in home settings and with other people.</li>
            <li>It reduces disease spread since they are in a cleaner environment.</li>
            <li>Fostering also benefits you since you're doing a good deed and made a friend along the way!</li>  
        </ol>

        <h2>My personal experience</h2>
        <p>I fostered a 2 year old dog in 2018, and had such a wonderful experience! Junebug, a coonhound mix, stayed with us for about a month before being adopted!</p>
