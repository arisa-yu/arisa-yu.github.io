        <h2>My bio:</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am a third-year student at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/"> UMass Amherst</a> who is pursuing an interdisciplinary degree in <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design?srsltid=AfmBOooTN4irLtTmuzFlC_YRzmpobpwujN5KgC5WHW-DSrK9cVJfOpmM"> UX design</a>  and business. I hope seek more opportunities to further develop my skills and knowledge in the user experience, digital marketing, and public relations industries to specifically dive deeper into topics that range from design thinking to implementing the research into efficient and intuitive products.</p>
