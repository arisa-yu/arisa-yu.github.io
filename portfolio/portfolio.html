                        <h3>Creative Collective</h3>
                        <p>This is my online portfolio that encompasses the digital and technical work that I have done throughout my college career. This includes graphics I have created for organizations that I have been a part of, like Sweets & More, The MDC, and UMass BDIC in addition to other coursework.</p>

                        <p>Utilizing the skills I had learned in an introductory Adobe Photoshop course I took in high school, I created various projects and graphics that allowed me to encapsulate the skills I learned regarding typography, color theory, and design principles into my senior year portfolio.</p>

                        <p>After being prompted to take a film to further analyze explore a topic of our choosing to invite deeper conversation, I chose to expand upon the topic of the disparity between the rich and poor in Hong Kong (specifically the housing crisis), which can often be glamorized or shielded by the media.</p>
