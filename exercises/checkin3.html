            <p>When my parents were younger, they got a SONY digital camera to capture photos of their vacations, but forgot about the camera after my brother and I were born. I found it in our attic and started documenting my college experience in addition to family vacations.</p>

            <p>I love taking (candid) photos of my friends, but I also like capturing landscapes and looking back on all the places that I have visited. I took this photo of a beach in Cape Cod when I went on a road trip with my friends this past summer! I look forward to taking more photos in the future and having my kids/family members/friends revisit all the fun times I had. </p>
            <p>I have some spring and summer trips planned out, so that will be exciting to document!</p>
